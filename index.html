                    <div class="text"><p>Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell was born on December 18, 2001, in Los Angeles, California,
                     where she also grew up. She comes from a creative family: her mother Maggie Baird is an actress and teacher, 
                     her father Patrick O’Connell is an actor and musician, and her older brother Finneas O’Connell is a singer, songwriter, and producer 
                     who works closely with her on almost all of her music. Billie was homeschooled, which gave her the freedom to focus on music, songwriting, 
                     and artistic development from a very young age.</p>

                        emotionally difficult for her, but it pushed her to concentrate more fully on music as her main creative outlet. Also, she still dances in her
                        clips and just for fun.</p>
